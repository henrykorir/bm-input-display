Input display for rhythm game controllers

# How to Use:

Double click on the bat file corresponding to a profile to run the input display using that profile.

Check the profiles folder to configure the profiles. There are a lot of things that can be configured. (layout, colors, keybinds, etc.)

If you make additional profiles, you might have to make separate .bat files for the new profiles. Open the .bat file in a text editor to check the format of the .bat file. It shouldn't be too hard to figure out from there.
